Why give your time to open source projects, ever? You're not paid for it. Your boss likely doesn't want the IP headache. Your code is going to be eaten by Anthropic. Maintainers probably reject most of your PRs.

Think about a cheap talk model. There is no better technology to signal to potential employers that you're a good developer. It's really, really hard for managers to tell the difference between a good developer and a bad one, let alone evaluate codebase quality. FOSS maintainers treat their work with a borderline religious tone. Hacker News treats FOSS development like an act of mercy. It's not! But by keeping the bar high, reliable FOSS projects can signal to potential employers that you know what you're doing. It's a little bit altruistic, sure, but the self-transcendence is probably just motivated reasoning for a self-serving strategy.
