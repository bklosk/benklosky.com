Why give your time to open source projects, ever? You're not paid for it. Your boss likely doesn't want the IP headache. Your code is going to be eaten by Anthropic. Maintainers probably reject most of your PRs.

However, there is no better technology to signal to potential employers that you're a good developer. It is hard for managers to tell the difference between a good developer and a bad one, let alone evaluate codebase quality. Open source contributions that are regularly accepted are a fantastic signal of human capital! There are few other industries where managers can actually observe someone's work before hiring them. Interviewing people *overwhelmingly* selects for people who are good at interviewing. Being good at interviewing is orthogonal to being good at coding. Being good at coding is correlated with being good at coding. Open source development helps you prove it. 

FOSS maintainers treat their work with a borderline religious tone. Hacker News treats FOSS development like an act of mercy. It's not! It's just that reliable FOSS contributors signal to potential employers that they know what they're doing. It's a little bit altruistic, sure, and I bet there are open source devs who *really believe that*, but the self-transcendence is probably just motivated reasoning for a self-serving strategy.
