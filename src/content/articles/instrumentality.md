I have been consistently shocked at how rarely strangers hurt each other. If you're murdered, it will be by your boyfriend, your family member, or your rival. Your murderer will be male, he will use a firearm (probably a handgun), it will likely happen at or near your home, and you will know him personally.

When I was working at a police department, I saw a lot of arrests. I saw a lot of crime, and more suffering than I would like to admit exists in the world. However, I don't think I saw a single murder that was seriously premeditated. 

Crimes that require serious planning were rare, mostly drug-related, and overwhelmingly non-violent. The violence that I witnessed came when opportunity arrived at the wrong time, not because of some cold-blooded monster plotting someone else's demise. We know because of work like Jens Ludwig's that most murders escalate from arguments; in my experience, this is true, and those murders that aren't heat-of-the-moment tend to be (1) from someone with serious cognitive impairments hurting their family or (2) gang related. 

Even in the case of gangs, I want to caution against viewing gangsters as indiscriminate murderers out hunting their enemies. They occasionally do that, sure, but many gang-related shootings are functions of happenstance, where someone accidentally runs into an opponent they weren't intending to. When one or both parties is always armed, it's easy to hit the murder button.

A fight will get out of hand, and someone who happens to have a handgun will use it.
