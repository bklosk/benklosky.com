The death penalty doesn't work. It costs a lot of money and doesn't deter crime. People kill each other, in states with and without it. Doesn't stop politicians from buying the death penalty at a steep price. 

When I was working at a police department, I saw a lot of arrests. I saw a lot of crime, and more suffering than I would like to admit exists in the world. However, I don't think I saw a single crime that was seriously premeditated. 

Crimes that require serious planning were rare, mostly drug-related, and overwhelmingly non-violent. Violence I saw happened when opportunity arrived at the wrong time, not because of planning.

I was consistently shocked at how rarely strangers hurt each other. If you're murdered, it will be by your boyfriend, your family member, or your rival. Your murderer will be male, he will use a firearm (probably a handgun), it will likely happen at or near your home, and you will know him personally.

A fight will get out of hand, and someone who happens to have a handgun will use it.
