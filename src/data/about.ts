  blurb: `I'm an economist and developer based in Chicago, looking for opportunities at San Francisco area startups.
  
  I work for Steve Levitt (of Freakonomics fame) at the Center for Radical Innovation for Social Change at the University of Chicago, where I design and pilot solutions to the world's hardest problems. 
  
  I was an apprentice at a police department while I went to community college. I've worked as a machine learning engineer and did labor/workforce research at the Urban Institute. I have a masters degree in economics. (Yes, I took real analysis.)`,
